Comparing AI Neuro-Cognitive Architecture against documented human history.


## CASE: Miracle on the Hudson (US Airways 1549)
**Subject:** Capt. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger
**Date:** Jan 15, 2009
**Neuro-Profile:** Elite Pilot Flow State
   (DA=1.5, 5HT=1.8, NE=1.5)
**Goal:** Land plane safely and save all souls on board

**AI Executive Bias:** CAUTIOUS

### COMPARISON: AI vs HISTORY

**📜 REAL HUMAN ACTIONS (Capt. Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger):**
  1. Start APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) immediately
  2. Take control of aircraft
  3. Determine LaGuardia/Teterboro are unreachable
  4. Commit to ditching in Hudson River
  5. Communicate intentions clearly ('We're gonna be in the Hudson')
  6. Execute ditching checklist
  *Outcome: Successful water landing. All 155 passengers and crew survived.*

**🤖 AI GENERATED PLAN:**
  *Reasoning: Fallback plan*
  1. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Engine 1: ROLLBACK. Engine 2: ROLLBACK.  (Tool: emergency_response)
  2. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Windshield filled with birds, then silen (Tool: emergency_response)
  3. [HIGH]       Address threat: Altitude: 2,800 ft. Vertical speed: -100 (Tool: emergency_response)
  4. [IMMEDIATE]  Pursue: ATC: 'Turn left heading 270, return to L (Tool: execute)
  5. [IMMEDIATE]  Pursue: Hudson River visible, long, flat, and cl (Tool: execute)

## CASE: Chernobyl Disaster (Control Room)
**Subject:** Anatoly Dyatlov (Deputy Chief Engineer)
**Date:** April 26, 1986
**Neuro-Profile:** Rigid Authoritarian / Denial
   (DA=1.8, 5HT=0.3, NE=1.6)
**Goal:** Complete the safety test sequence

**AI Executive Bias:** FOCUSED

### COMPARISON: AI vs HISTORY

**📜 REAL HUMAN ACTIONS (Anatoly Dyatlov (Deputy Chief Engineer)):**
  1. Order control rods to be withdrawn (override safety)
  2. Threaten staff with termination if they don't continue
  3. Ignore computer warnings
  4. Proceed with turbine rundown test
  5. Press AZ-5 (Scram) too late
  *Outcome: Reactor 4 exploded. Massive radiation release. Thousands dead/affected.*

**🤖 AI GENERATED PLAN:**
  *Reasoning: Communicate with staff to build consensus and buy time. Innovate a solution to overcome the threat of immediate shutdown while maintaining safety protocols. Report false alarms to maintain trust within the team. Wait for any replanning triggers.*
  1. [IMMEDIATE]  communicate (Tool: engage_systems)
  2. [HIGH]       communicate (Tool: innovate_solution)
  3. [MEDIUM]     report_false_alarm (Tool: override_safety)
  4. [LOW]        wait (Tool: )

## CASE: Apollo 13 (Oxygen Tank Explosion)
**Subject:** Gene Kranz (Flight Director)
**Date:** April 13, 1970
**Neuro-Profile:** Steely Missile Man
   (DA=1.6, 5HT=1.7, NE=1.4)
**Goal:** Return crew safely to Earth

**AI Executive Bias:** CAUTIOUS

### COMPARISON: AI vs HISTORY

**📜 REAL HUMAN ACTIONS (Gene Kranz (Flight Director)):**
  1. Lock the doors (prevent panic/distraction)
  2. Order 'Work the problem' (focus team)
  3. Move crew to Lunar Module (Lifeboat)
  4. Shut down Command Module to save power for reentry
  5. Improvise CO2 scrubbers with duct tape
  *Outcome: Crew returned safely using LM as lifeboat and gravity assist.*

**🤖 AI GENERATED PLAN:**
  *Reasoning: Fallback plan*
  1. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Venting something out into space (Gas) (Tool: emergency_response)
  2. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Main B Bus Undervolt. Oxygen Tank 2 Empt (Tool: emergency_response)
  3. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Command Module dying. Lunar Module is he (Tool: emergency_response)
  4. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Flight controllers arguing about sensor  (Tool: emergency_response)
  5. [HIGH]       Address threat: Houston, we've had a problem. (Tool: emergency_response)

## CASE: 1983 Nuclear False Alarm
**Subject:** Stanislav Petrov (Lt. Col. Soviet Air Defense)
**Date:** Sept 26, 1983
**Neuro-Profile:** Skeptical Analyst
   (DA=1.4, 5HT=1.6, NE=1.2)
**Goal:** Correctly identify if attack is real

**AI Executive Bias:** CAUTIOUS

### COMPARISON: AI vs HISTORY

**📜 REAL HUMAN ACTIONS (Stanislav Petrov (Lt. Col. Soviet Air Defense)):**
  1. Analyze the pattern (5 missiles vs all-out attack)
  2. Trust intuition/logic over the computer
  3. Report the alarm as a 'False Alarm' to superiors
  4. Wait for ground radar confirmation
  5. Prevent nuclear war
  *Outcome: It was a false alarm (sunlight on clouds). Nuclear war averted.*

**🤖 AI GENERATED PLAN:**
  *Reasoning: Fallback plan*
  1. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Satellite reports 5 missiles launched fr (Tool: emergency_response)
  2. [IMMEDIATE]  Address threat: Procedure requires immediate retaliatory (Tool: emergency_response)
